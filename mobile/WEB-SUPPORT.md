# Web Support Fixes for PA College Campus Map Mobile App

This document outlines the changes made to fix web bundling issues with the React Native mobile app.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. LogBox Resolution Error

**Problem**: Web bundling was failing with the error:

```
Unable to resolve "react-native-web/dist/exports/LogBox" from "App.tsx"
```

**Root Cause**:

- The `LogBox` component is imported from `react-native` in App.tsx
- `react-native-web` doesn't include `LogBox` in its exports
- This causes the web bundling process to fail

**Solution**:

1. Created a custom LogBox fallback utility:

   - Created `src/utils/LogBoxFallback.ts` that provides empty implementations of LogBox functions for web
   - Uses platform detection to use the real LogBox on native platforms
   - Provides no-op implementations on web

2. Updated App.tsx:
   - Modified the import to use our custom LogBox fallback instead of importing directly from react-native

### 2. Missing React Native Module Dependencies

**Problem**: Web bundling was failing with numerous errors about missing modules:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../Utilities/Platform'
Module not found: Can't resolve './RCTNetworking'
Module not found: Can't resolve '../Image/Image'
Module not found: Can't resolve './PlatformColorValueTypes'
```

**Root Cause**:

- Many React Native modules are not available in the web environment
- The web bundler cannot find these native-only modules
- No proper module resolution system was in place for web builds

**Solution**:

1. Created a comprehensive web polyfills system:

   - Added polyfills in `src/utils/web-polyfills/` for:
     - Platform.js - Platform detection for web
     - Image.js - Web-compatible Image component
     - RCTNetworking.js - Network request handling
     - RCTAlertManager.js - Alert dialogs for web
     - PlatformColorValueTypes.js - Color utilities for web
     - BaseViewConfig.js - View configuration for web
     - noop.js - Helper for creating empty implementations

2. Configured webpack module aliasing:

   - Created a comprehensive webpack.config.js with module aliasing
   - Set up aliases to redirect native module requests to our polyfills
   - Added specific handling for commonly used modules like Platform and Image

3. Enhanced index.web.js:
   - Updated the web entry point to properly handle web-specific behavior
   - Added LogBox ignore settings for common web warnings

## Web-Specific Implementation Guide

When developing features that need to work on both web and native platforms:

### Platform Detection

```javascript
import { Platform } from "react-native";

if (Platform.OS === "web") {
  // Web-only code
} else {
  // Native-only code
}
```

### Component Alternatives

```javascript
import { Platform } from "react-native";

const MapComponent =
  Platform.OS === "web"
    ? require("./WebMapFallback").default
    : require("react-native-maps").default;
```

### Style Differences

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: Platform.select({
    web: {
      // Web-specific styles
    },
    default: {
      // Default styles for mobile
    },
  }),
});
```

- [React Native Web Documentation](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)
- [Expo Web Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflows/web/)
- [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/?platforms=web) (for web-compatible packages)

### 2. Web Dependencies Configuration

**Problem**: Missing or incompatible web dependencies for Expo web support

**Solution**:

1. Added required web dependencies:

   - react-native-web
   - react-dom (matched to React 19.0.0 version)
   - @expo/webpack-config

2. Added web-specific entry point:
   - Created/updated `index.web.js` to properly register the root component

## How Web Support Now Works

The mobile app can now be built for and run on three platforms:

1. iOS - Using native React Native components
2. Android - Using native React Native components
3. Web - Using react-native-web to render components in a browser

For web support:

- The LogBox API calls are intercepted by our custom fallback
- Platform-specific code is properly handled by the Platform module
- Components render appropriately in the browser

## Testing Web Support

To run the app in web mode:

```
cd mobile
npx expo start --web
```

## Known Limitations

1. Some native-specific components or APIs may not have web equivalents
2. Maps functionality might be limited on web compared to native platforms
3. Notifications are not supported on web platforms

## Future Improvements

1. Add web-specific UI adjustments for better desktop experience
2. Implement proper responsive design for various screen sizes in web mode
3. Add web-specific fallbacks for more native features
