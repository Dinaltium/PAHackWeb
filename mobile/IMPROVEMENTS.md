- Implemented methods to save and retrieve map data for offline use
- Added UI indicators showing when offline mode is active
- Updated Settings screen to allow management of offline data

### 2. Deep Linking

- Implemented deep linking configuration in `linkingUtils.ts`
- Added support for linking to specific buildings, distance calculator and schedule
- Created shareable links for building information
- Added share button to building details to demonstrate deep linking

### 3. Notifications for Schedule Reminders

- Implemented `NotificationService` for scheduling and managing notifications

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

- Created comprehensive testing documentation (TESTING.md)
- Added guidance for testing on emulators and physical devices
- Provided instructions for testing offline functionality and deep linking
- Documented known issues and limitations

## Implementation Details

### Offline Mode

The offline functionality uses React Context API and AsyncStorage to:

- Detect network status changes using NetInfo
- Store map data in device storage when enabled
- Show visual indicators when operating in offline mode
- Allow users to update or clear offline data

### Deep Linking

Deep linking is implemented using React Navigation's linking configuration to:

- Support app scheme URLs (pacampusmap://)
- Handle links to specific buildings by ID
- Support links to specific features like the distance calculator
- Create shareable URLs that work across devices

### Notifications

Notification support uses Expo Notifications to:

- Schedule class reminders at configurable times before class start
- Store and manage notification preferences per class
- Enable/disable reminders with a simple toggle UI
- Show appropriate reminder information including location and time

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

1. **Sync with Web Version**: Implement a sync mechanism to share data between web and mobile
2. **Enhanced Offline Support**: Add support for caching schedule and other dynamic data
3. **Background Sync**: Add background tasks to update data periodically
4. **Advanced Notifications**: Add more customization options for reminder timing
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Optimize map rendering for better battery life
6. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance app accessibility features

All these features have been implemented with code sharing in mind, maintaining the same data structures and patterns used in the web version for consistency and easier maintenance.
