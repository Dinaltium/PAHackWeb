# Mobile Map Fixes for PA College Engineering Campus Map

This document outlines the changes made to fix issues with the React Native mobile app map functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RNMapsAirModule Error

**Problem**: The app was failing with an error message:

```
Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNMapsAirModule' could not be found
```

and

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

**Root Cause**:

- The app was configured to use the new React Native architecture (`newArchEnabled: true`) in app.json
- React Native Maps library is not fully compatible with the new architecture in this setup
- The package was encountering JSX syntax in CommonJS modules

**Solution**:

- Disabled the new architecture in app.json by changing `"newArchEnabled": true` to `"newArchEnabled": false`
- Removed the React Native Maps plugin from the expo plugins array
- Downgraded react-native-maps to a compatible version (1.3.2)
- Removed the PROVIDER_GOOGLE reference that was causing compatibility issues

### 2. Map Provider Issues

**Problem**: There were provider compatibility issues across platforms

**Solution**:

- Modified MapView component to remove the provider prop entirely, letting the map use the default provider
- Added error handling to detect and handle map loading failures
- Added user-friendly error UI with retry functionality

### 3. Added Error Handling

- Created error state to track map loading issues
- Added visual feedback for error conditions
- Implemented retry mechanism
- Added error boundary for map component to prevent app crashes

## Dependencies Updated/Installed

- Reinstalled react-native-maps with a specific version (1.3.2)
- Installed expo-location
- Confirmed installation of other required dependencies:
  - expo-notifications
  - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
  - @react-native-community/netinfo

## Configuration Changes

### Updated app.json:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "PA Campus Map",
    "slug": "pa-campus-map",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
    "newArchEnabled": false,
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash-icon.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "plugins": ["expo-notifications"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.pacollege.campusmap"
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      },
      "edgeToEdgeEnabled": true,
      "package": "com.pacollege.campusmap",
      "permissions": ["ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION", "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"]
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    },
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "pa-campus-map"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix:

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed:

   ```
   cd mobile
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Expo development server:

   ```
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Test on both iOS and Android simulators/devices

   - The map should load without errors
   - Building markers should appear
   - Location tracking should work

4. Test offline functionality by enabling airplane mode:
   - App should display offline banner
   - Cached map data should be visible if previously saved
